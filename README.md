## File Management

Python provides powerful modules like `os` and `shutil` for managing files and directories. These modules allow tasks such as file creation, deletion, renaming, copying, and directory traversal.

```python
import os

# Example: List all files in a directory
for filename in os.listdir('/path/to/directory'):
    print(filename)
